# Always-Gonna-Block-You-List

A comprehensive block list for uBlock Origin designed to keep you free from Rick Astley and rickrolls. Ideal for those who are tired, sick and ill of the neverending endless loops of "Never Gonna Give You Up" and just want to surf the web free of rick astley, avoiding the unexpected surprises from dodgy links sent by Friends or Family, Foe or Enemy.

## Why?  

Overtime people and parents have noticed that Generation Z is increasingly affected by online memes and forms of digital trolling , in which often contribute to the ever present decline in mental focus. This issue first struck gold around 2007 with a 4chan user tricking others into clicking a link claiming to offer a leak for the game Grand Theft Auto IV. Instead, the link redirected to Rick Astley's hit song "Never Gonna Give You Up," marking the birth of the infamous Rickroll meme. Such trolling has evolved, leading to spikes in dopamine levels from viral hits, which distract and undermine learning.

To combat this, I've proposed the "Always Going to Block You List" essentially a Rickroll block for your browser. This tool aims to protect users from these distractions, improving online focus and productivity.

## Features
- Blocks all sources I know of Rick Astley content.
- Prevents rickrolls from sketch links.
- Keeps your browsing experience free from Rick Astley and unwanted interruptions.

## How to Use
1. **Install uBlock Origin**: Ensure [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) is installed in your browser.
2. **Import the List**:
   - Open uBlock Origin's dashboard.
   - Click on the "Filters List" tab found along the top.
   - Scroll to the bottom and click on "Import" and paste the URL of this [Block List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrimeMonket/Always-Gonna-Block-You-List/main/RickAstley-Blocker.txt).
   - Dont forget to click apply.
3. **Enjoy a Rickroll-Free Experience**!
